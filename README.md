I wrote a bit about how I built this on my blog

- [Timed Finite State Machines with React and XState](https://altrim.io/posts/timed-finite-state-machines-with-react-and-xstate)

The app is built using

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [XState](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate)
- [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai)
